# /build — ROM Runner build & run helper

You are working inside the **ROM Runner** repo.

## What to do
1) Read README.md and docs/guides/ROM_Runner_Quick_Reference.md for the latest commands.
2) If commands are missing, propose the smallest set of build/run instructions to add (do **not** guess).
3) Keep changes minimal and cross-platform (macOS/Windows/Linux + remote Unraid dev server).

## Guardrails
- **Do not** commit secrets (API keys, tokens, .env files). If you need MCP/Context7, use `.cursor/mcp-config.example.json` as reference and keep `.cursor/mcp-config.json` local-only.
- Prefer incremental diffs and explain what you changed and why.
